                 Experiment: Network Anomaly Lifecycle
             draft-netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle-03

Abstract

   Network Anomaly Detection is the act of detecting problems in the
   network.  Accurately detect problems is very challenging for network
   operators in production networks.  Good results require a lot of
   expertise and knowledge around both the implied network technologies
   and the specific service provided to consumers, apart from a proper
   monitoring infrastructure.  In order to facilitate network anomaly
   detection, novel techniques are being introduced, including
   programmatical, rule-based and AI-based, with the promise of
   improving scalability and the hope to keep a high detection accuracy.
   To guarantee acceptable results, the process needs to be properly
   designed, adopting well-defined stages to accurately collect evidence
   of anomalies, validate their relevancy and improve the detection
   systems over time, iteratively.

   This document describes a well-defined approach on managing the
   lifecycle process of a network anomaly detection system, spanning
   across the recording of its output and its iterative refinement, in
   order to facilitate network engineers to interact with the network
   anomaly detection system, enable the "human-in-the-loop" paradigm and
   refine the detection abilities over time.  The major contributions of
   this document are: the definition of three key stages of the
   lifecycle process, the definition of a state machine for each anomaly
   annotation on the system and the definition of YANG data models
   describing a comprehensive format for the anoamaly labels, allowing a
   well structured exchange of those between all the interested actors.

1.  Discussion Venues

   This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   Discussion of this document takes place on the Operations and
   Management Area Working Group Working Group mailing list
   (nmop@ietf.org), which is archived at
   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/nmop/.

   anomaly-lifecycle.

2.  Status of this document

   This document is experimental.  The main goal of this document is to
   propose an iterative lifecycle process to network anomaly detection
   by proposing a data model for metadata to be addressed at different
   lifecycle stages.

   The experiment consists of verifying whether the approach is usable
   in real use case scenarios to support proper refinement and
   adjustments of network anomaly detection algorithms.  The experiment
   can be deemed successful if validated at least with an open-source
   implementation sucessfully applied with real networks.

3.  Introduction

   In [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology] A network anomaly is defined as "an
   unusual or unexpected event or pattern in network data in the
   forwarding plane, control plane, or management plane that deviates
   from the normal, expected behavior".

   A network problem is defined as "A state regarded as undesirable and
   may require remedial action" (see [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology]).

   The main objective of a network anomaly detection system is to
   identify Relevant States of the network (defined as states that have
   relevancy for network operators, according to
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology] ), as they could lead to problems or
   might be clear indications of problem already happening.

   That said, it is still remarkably difficult to gain a full
   understanding and a complete perspective of "if" and "how" a relevant
   state is actually an indication of a problem or it is just
   unexpected, but has no impact on end users.  Anomaly detection
   providers should aim at increasing accuracy, by minimizing false
   positives and false negatives.  Moreover, the behaviour of the

   network naturally changes over time, when more services are deployed,
   more customers on-boarded, devices are upgraded or replaced, and
   therefore it is almost impossible to build an anomaly detection
   system that remains accurate over time.

   This opens up to the necessity of further validating notified
   relevant states to check if the detected symptoms are actually
   impacting services: this might require different actors (both human
   and algorithmic) to jump in during the process and refine their
   understanding across the network anomaly lifecycle.

   Finally, once validation has happened, this might lead to refinements
   to the logic that is used by the detection, so that this process can
   improve the detection accuracy over time.

   Performing network anomaly detection is a process that requires a
   continuous learning and continuous improvement.  Relevant states are
   detected by aggregating and understanding symptoms, then validated,
   confirming that symptoms actually impacted network services impacting
   and eventually need to be further analyzed by performing postmortem
   analysis to identify any potential adjustment to improve the
   detection capability.  Each of these steps represents an opportunity
   to learn and refine the process, and since implementations of these
   steps might also be provided by different parties and/or products,
   this document also contributes a formal data model to capture and
   exchange symptom information across the lifecycle.

4.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   *  State

   *  Problem

   *  Event

   *  Alarm

   *  Symptom

   The following terms are used as defined in [RFC9417].

   *  Metric

   *  Intent

   The following terms are defined in this document.

   *  Annotator: Is a human or an algorithm which produces metadata by
      describing anomalies with symptoms.

   *  False Positive: Is a detected anomaly which has been identified
      during the postmortem to be not anomalous.

   *  False Negative: Is anomalous but has been not been identified by
      the anomaly detection system.

5.  Defining Desired States

   The above definitions of network problem provide the scope for what
   to be looking for when detecting network anomalies.  Concepts like
   "desirable state" and "required state" are introduced.  This poses
   the attention on a significant problem that network operators have to
   face: the definition of what is to be considered "desirable" or
   "undesirable".  It is not always easy to detect if a network is
   operating in an undesired state at a given point in time.  To
   approach this, network operators can rely on different methodologies,
   more or less deterministic and more or less sensitive: on the one
   side, the definition of intents (including Service Level Objectives
   and Service Level Agreements) which approaches the problem top-down;
   on the other side, the definition of symptoms, by mean of solutions
   like SAIN [RFC9417], [RFC9418] and
   [I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture], which approaches the
   problem bottom-up.  At the center of these approaches, there are the
   so-called symptoms, explaining what is not working as expected in the
   network, sometimes also providing hints towards issues and their
   causes.

   One of the more deterministic approaches is to rely on symptoms based
   on measurable service-based KPIs, for example, by using Service Level
   Indicators, Objectives and Agreements:

   Service Level Agreement (SLA)  An SLA is an agreement between parties
      that a service provider makes to its customers on the behavior of
      the provided service.  SLAs are a tool to define exactly what
      customers can expect out of the service provided to them.  In many
      cases, SLA breaches also come with contractual penalties.

Internet-Draft          network-anomaly-lifecycle              July 2024


   Service Level Objectives (SLOs)  An SLO is a threshold above which
      the service provider acts to prevent a breach of an SLA.  SLOs are
      a tool for service providers to know when they should start
      becoming concerned about a service not behaving as expected.  SLOs
      are rarely connected to penalties as they usually are internal
      metrics for the service providers.

   Service Level Indicators (SLIs)  An SLI is an observable metric that
      describes the state of a monitored subsystem.  SLIs are a tool to
      gain measurable visibility about the behavior of a subsystem in
      the network.  SLIs usually differ from SLOs as SLOs are usually
      expressed as thresholds, while SLIs would often be expressed e.g.
      as percentages.

   However, the definition of these KPIs turns out to be very
   challenging in some cases, as accurate KPIs could require
   computationally expensive techniques to be collected or substantial
   modifications to existing network protocols.

   Alternative methodologies rely on symptoms as the way to generate
   analytical data out of operational data.  For instance:

   SAIN  introduces the definition and exposure of symptoms as a
      mechanism for detecting those concerning behaviors in more
      deterministic ways.  Moreover, the concept of "impact score" has
      been introduced by SAIN, to indicate what is the expected degree
      of impact that a given symptom will have on the services relying
      on the related subservice to which the symptom is attached.

   Daisy  introduces the concept of concern score to indicate what is
      the degree of concern that a given symptom could cause a
      degradation for a service.

   In general, defining boundaries between desirable vs. undesirable in
   an accurate fashion requires continuous iterations and improvements
   coming from all the stages of the network anomaly detection
   lifecycle, by which network engineers can transfer what they learn
   through the process into new symptom definitions and, ultimately,
   into refinements of the detection algorithms.

6.  Lifecycle of a Network Anomaly

   The lifecycle of a network anomaly can be articulated in three
   phases, structured as a loop: Detection, Validation, Refinement.

              Figure 1: Anomaly Detection Refinement Lifecycle

   Each of these phases can either be performed by a network expert or
   an algorithm or complementing each other.

   The network anomaly metadata is generated by an annotator, which can
   be either a human expert or an algorithm.  The annotator can produce
   the metadata for a network anomaly, for each stage of the cycle and
   even multiple versions for the same stage.  In each version of the
   network anomaly metadata, the annotator indicates the list of
   symptoms that are part of the network anomaly taken into account.
   The iterative process is about the identification of the right set of
   symptoms.

6.1.  Network Anomaly Detection

   The Network Anomaly Detection stage is about the continuous
   monitoring of the network through Network Telemetry [RFC9232] and the
   identification of symptoms.  One of the main requirements that
   operator have on network anomaly detection systems is the high
   accuracy.  This means having a small number of false negatives,
   symptoms causing service impact are not missed, and false positives,
   symptoms that are actually innocuous are not picked up.

   As the detection stage is becoming more and more automated for
   production networks, the identified symptoms might point towards
   three potential kinds of behaviors:

   i. those that are surely corresponding to an impact on services,
   (e.g. the breach of an SLO),

   ii. those that will cause problems in the future (e.g. rising trends
   on a timeseries metric hitting towards saturation),

   iii. those or which the impact to services cannot be confirmed (e.g.
   sudden increase/decrease of timeseries metrics, anomalous amounts of
   log entries, etc.).

Internet-Draft          network-anomaly-lifecycle              July 2024


   The first category requires immediate intervention (a.k.a. the
   problem is "confirmed"), the second one provides pointers towards
   early signs of an problem potentially happening in the near future
   (a.k.a. the problem is "forecasted"), and the third one requires some
   analysis to confirm if the detected symptom requires any attention or
   immediate intervention (a.k.a. the problem is "potential").  As part
   of the iterative improvement required in this stage, one that is very
   relevant is the gradual conversion of the third category into one of
   the first two, which would make the network anomaly detection system
   more deterministic.  The main objective is to reduce uncertainty
   around the raised alarms by refining the detection algorithms.  This
   can be achieved by either generating new symptom definitions,
   adjusting the weights of automated algorithms or other similar
   approaches.

6.2.  Network Anomaly Validation

   The key objective for the validation stage is clearly to decide if
   the detected symptoms are signaling a real problem (a.k.a. requires
   action) or if they are to be treated as false positives (a.k.a.
   suppressing the alarm).  For those symptoms surely having impact on
   services, 100% confidence on the fact that a network problem is
   happening can be assumed.  For the other two categories, "forecasted"
   and "potential", further analysis and validation is required.

6.3.  Network Anomaly Refinement

   After validation of a problem, the service provider performs
   troubleshooting and resolution of the problem.  Although the network
   might be back in a desired state at this point, network operators can
   perform detailed postmortem analysis of network problems with the
   objective to identify useful adjustments to the prevention and
   detection mechanisms (for instance improving or extending the
   definition of SLIs and SLOs, refining concern/impact scores, etc.),
   and improving the accuracy of the validation stage (e.g. automating
   parts of the validation, implementing automated root cause analysis
   and automation for remediation actions).  In this stage of the
   lifecycle it is assumed that the problem is under analysis.

   After the adjustments are performed to the network anomaly detection
   methods, the cycle starts again, by "replaying" the network anomaly
   and checking if there is any measurable improvement in the ability to
   detect problems by using the updated method.

7.  Network Anomaly State Machine

   In the context of this document, from a network anomaly detection
   point of view a network problem is defined as a collection of
   interrelated symptoms, as specified in
   [I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-semantics].

   The understanding of a network problem can change over time.
   Moreover, multiple actors are involved in the process of refining
   this understanding in the different phases.

   From this perspective, a problem can be refined according to the
   following states (Figure 2).

               Figure 4: YANG module for ietf-relevant-state

   The model has been defined based on a list of requirements, defined
   in the following.  The data model:

      must be semantically consistent from a networking point of view;

      must be both human and machine readable;





Riccobene, et al.        Expires 9 January 2025                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft          network-anomaly-lifecycle              July 2024


      must allow different detection, validation and refinement
      solutions to interoperate;

      must provide support the "human-in-the-loop" paradigm, allowing
      for network experts to validate and adjust network anomaly labels
      and detection systems.

   The base for the modules is the relevant-state data model.  Relevant
   state is at the root of the data model, with its parameters (ID,
   description, start-time, end-time) and a collection of anomalies.
   This allows the relevant state to be considered as a container of
   anomalies.

   Each anomaly is characterized by some intrinsic fields (such as id,
   version, state, description, start-time, end-time, confidence score
   and pattern) Particularly the confidence score is a measure of how
   confident was the detector in considering the given anomaly as an
   anomalous behaviour.

   Each anomaly also include the symptom and the service container.
   These containers are placeholders to represent the information about
   the symptom (what is exaclty happening as anomalous behaviour) and
   the service (what entity is affected by the anomaly).  In particular,
   for what concerns the symptom, a concern score is defined, which has
   the meaning of expressing how much the anomaly is impacting services.
   Based on the intentions of the authors of this data model, the
   correct use of the symptom and service containers is to augment the
   model by providing a more accurate implementation of both of them.
   An example of this is provided in
   [I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-semantics], where an augmentation of
   symptom and service for L3VPN is proposed.

   Also a list of various actors that can be involved in the process is
   presented as following:

   In the detection stage:  the detectors can be Network Engineers and/
      or Automatic detectors (including Rule-based detectors and ML-
      based detectors)

   In the validation stage:  the validators can be Network Engineers
      manually validating the labels

   In the refinement stage:  the refiners can be Data Scientists and/or
      Automatic Refiners (including systems that automatically refine
      the detection systems, based on the validated labels).

   The data model that has been defined is used in two YANG modules: the
   relevant-state-notification and the ietf-relevant-state: the
   notification is primarily used by the Network Anomaly Detector, to
   notify the "Alert and Problem Management System" and the "Post-mortem
   System" (see [I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture]); the
   container instead is used inside the Post-mortem system to exhance
   anomaly detection lables between the anomaly detection stages defined
   above (valdation, refinement, detection).

9.  Implementation status

   This section provides pointers to existing open source
   implementations of this draft.  Note to the RFC-editor: Please remove
   this before publishing.

9.1.  Antagonist

   An open source implementation for this draft is called AnTagOnIst
   (Anomaly Tagging On hIstorical data), and it has been implemented in
   order to validate the application of the YANG model defined in this
   draft.  Antagonist provides visual support for two important use
   cases in the scope of this document:

   *  the generation of a ground truth in relation to symptoms and
      problems in timeseries data

   *  the visual validation of results produced by automated network
      anomaly detection tools.

   The open source code can be found here: [Antagonist]

   As part of the experiment that was conducted with AnTagOnIst, Some
   main Use Case scenarios have been validated so far:

      Exposure of a GUI for human validation of the labels.

      Integration with Rule Based anomaly detection systems.  In
      particular the integration with SAIN and Cosmos Bright Lights is
      on going.

      Integration with ML-based detection systems.

10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations will have to be updated according to
   "https://wiki.ietf.org/group/ops/yang-security-guidelines".
