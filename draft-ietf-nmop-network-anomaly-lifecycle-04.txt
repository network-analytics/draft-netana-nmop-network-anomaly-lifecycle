           An Experiment: Network Anomaly Detection Lifecycle
              draft-ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle-04

Abstract

   Network Anomaly Detection is the act of detecting problems in the
   network.  Accurately detecting problems is very challenging for
   network operators in production networks.  Good results require a lot
   of expertise and knowledge around both the implied network
   technologies and the connectivity services provided to customers,
   apart from a proper monitoring infrastructure.  In order to
   facilitate network anomaly detection, novel techniques are being
   introduced, including programmatical, rule-based and AI-based, with
   the promise of improving scalability and the hope to keep a high
   detection accuracy.  To guarantee acceptable results, the process
   needs to be properly designed, adopting well-defined stages to
   accurately collect evidence of anomalies, validate their relevancy
   and improve the detection systems over time, iteratively.

   This document describes a well-defined approach on managing the
   lifecycle process of a network anomaly detection system, spanning
   across the recording of its output and its iterative refinement, in
   order to facilitate network engineers to interact with the network
   anomaly detection system, enable the "human-in-the-loop" paradigm and
   refine the detection abilities over time.  The major contributions of
   this document are: the definition of three key stages of the
   lifecycle process, the definition of a state machine for each anomaly
   annotation on the system and the definition of YANG data models
   describing a comprehensive format for the anomaly labels, allowing a
   well-structured exchange of those between all the interested actors.

1.  Introduction

   The main objective of a network anomaly detection syste is to
   identify Relevant States of the network as those are States that
   could lead to problems or might be clear indications of problems
   already happening.

   An architecture for network anomaly detection is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture].

   It is still remarkably difficult to gain a full understanding and a
   complete perspective of "if" and "how" a Relevant State is actually
   an indication of a Problem or it is just unexpected, but has no
   impact on services and end users.  Providers of solutions for network
   anomaly detection should aim at increasing accuracy, by minimizing
   False Positives and False Negatives.  Moreover, the behaviour of the
   network naturally changes over time.  When more connectivity services
   are deployed, more customers are on-boarded to the network, network
   devices are upgraded or replaced, and therefore, it is almost
   impossible to identify anomaly detection techniques that can keep
   working accurately over time, without changing the detection
   criterias (or methodologies) over time.

   This opens up to the necessity of further validating notified
   Relevant States to check if a detected symptom is actually impacting
   connectivity services: this might require different actors (both
   human and algorithmic) to act together during the process and refine
   their understanding across the network anomaly lifecycle.

Internet-Draft          network-anomaly-lifecycle          November 2025


   Finally, once validation has happened, this might lead to refinements
   to the logic that is used by the detection, so that this process can
   improve the detection accuracy over time.

   Performing network anomaly detection is a process that requires a
   continuous learning and continuous improvement.  Relevant States are
   detected by aggregating and understanding Symptoms, then validated,
   confirming that Symptoms actually impacted connectivity services and
   eventually need to be further analyzed by performing postmortem
   analysis to identify any potential adjustment to improve the
   detection capability.  Each of these steps represents an opportunity
   to learn and refine the process, and since implementations of these
   steps might also be provided by different parties and/or products,
   this document also contributes a formal data model to capture and
   exchange Symptom information across the lifecycle.

   The adjustment of the detection process can happen after problems are
   solved and well understood, so the learning can be transferred into
   the detection system for future faster detections.  For this reason,
   the network anomaly Detection lifecycle mainly relates to the post-
   mortem stage of the network anomaly detection process, as described
   in [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture].

2.  Status of this document

   This document is experimental.  The main goal of this document is to
   propose an iterative lifecycle process to network anomaly detection
   by proposing a data model for network anomaly metadata to be
   addressed at different lifecycle stages.

   The experiment consists of verifying whether the approach is usable
   in real use case scenarios to support proper refinement and
   adjustments of network anomaly detection algorithms.  The experiment
   can be deemed successful if validated at least with an open-source
   implementation successfully applied with real networks.

   *  Problem

   *  Alarm

   *  Symptom

   *  Relevance and Relevant State

   *  Network Anomaly

   The following terms are used as defined in [RFC9417].

   *  Metric

   *  Intent

   The following terms are defined in this document.

   *  Annotator: Is a human or an algorithm which produces metadata by
      describing anomalies with Symptoms.

   *  False Positive: Is a detected anomaly which has been identified
      during the postmortem to be not anomalous.

   *  False Negative: Is anomalous but has not been identified by the
      anomaly detection system.

   *  Confidence Score: Indicates the degree of how abnormal the
      detected anomaly is.

   *  Concern Score: Indicates the possible degree of connectivity
      service degradation by taking the Confidence Scores from multiple
      anomalies and their relationships into account.

4.  Defining Desired States

   The Problem, as defined in Section 1, provide the scope for what to
   be looking for when detecting network anomalies.  This poses the
   attention on a significant Problem that network operators have to
   face: the definition of what is to be considered "desirable" or
   "undesirable".  It is not always easy to detect if a network is
   operating in an undesired State at a given point in time.  To
   approach this, network operators can rely on different methodologies,
   more or less deterministic and more or less sensitive: on the one
   side, the definition of Intents (including Service Level Objectives
   and Service Level Agreements) which approaches the Problem top-down;
   on the other side, the definition of Symptoms, by mean of solutions
   like SAIN [RFC9417], [RFC9418] and



Riccobene, et al.          Expires 15 May 2026                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          network-anomaly-lifecycle          November 2025


   [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture], which approaches the
   Problem bottom-up.  At the center of these approaches, there are the
   so-called Symptoms, explaining what is not working as expected in the
   network, sometimes also providing hints towards issues and their
   causes.

   One of the more deterministic approaches is to rely on Symptoms based
   on measurable service-based KPIs, for example, by using Service Level
   Indicators, Objectives and Agreements [RFC9543].  This is the case
   when rules on SLOs and SLIs are manually defined once and the used
   afterwards for detection at runtime.

   However, defining SLOs in a "static way" can bring some challenges as
   well, related to the dynamic nature of networks and services.

   Alternative methodologies rely on a more "relaxed" approach to detect
   symptoms and their impact to services as a way to generate analytical
   data out of operational data.  For instance:

   SAIN  introduces the definition and exposure of Symptoms as a
      mechanism for detecting those concerning behaviors in a more
      deterministic way.  Moreover, the concept of "impact score" has
      been introduced by SAIN, to indicate what is the expected degree
      of impact that a given Symptom will have on the services relying
      on the related subservice to which the Symptom is attached.

   Daisy  introduces the concept of "Concern Score" to indicate what is
      the degree of concern that a given Symptom could cause a
      degradation for a connectivity service.

   In general, defining boundaries between desirable vs.  undesirable in
   an accurate fashion requires continuous iterations and improvements
   coming from all the stages of the network anomaly detection
   lifecycle, by which network engineers can transfer what they learn
   through the process into new Symptom definitions and, ultimately,
   into refinements of the detection algorithms.

5.  Lifecycle of a Network Anomaly

   The lifecycle of a network anomaly can be articulated in three
   phases, structured as a loop: Detection, Validation, Refinement.

              Figure 1: Anomaly Detection Refinement Lifecycle

   Each of these phases can either be performed by a network expert or
   an algorithm or complementing each other.

   The network anomaly metadata is generated by an Annotator, which can
   be either a human expert or an algorithm.  The Annotator can produce
   the metadata for a network anomaly, for each stage of the cycle and
   even multiple versions for the same stage.  In each version of the
   network anomaly metadata, the Annotator indicates the list of
   Symptoms that are part of the network anomaly taken into account.
   The iterative process is about the identification of the right set of
   Symptoms.

5.1.  Network Anomaly Detection

   The Network Anomaly Detection stage is about the continuous
   monitoring of the network through Network Telemetry [RFC9232] and the
   identification of Symptoms.  One of the main requirements that
   operators have on network anomaly detection systems is the high
   accuracy.  This means having a small number of False Negatives, i.e.
   Symptoms causing connectivity service impact are not missed, and low
   amount of False Positives, i.e. Symptoms that are actually innocuous
   are not picked up.

   As the detection stage is becoming more and more automated for
   production networks, the identified Symptoms might point towards
   three potential kinds of behaviors:

   i. those that are surely corresponding to an impact on connectivity
   services, (e.g. the breach of an SLO),

   ii. those that will cause Problems in the future (e.g. rising trends
   on a timeseries Metric hitting towards saturation),

   iii. those or which the impact to connectivity services cannot be
   confirmed (e.g. sudden increase/decrease of timeseries Metrics,
   anomalous amounts of log entries, etc.).

Internet-Draft          network-anomaly-lifecycle          November 2025


   The first category requires immediate intervention (a.k.a.  the
   problem is "confirmed"), the second one provides pointers towards
   early signs of an problem potentially happening in the near future
   (a.k.a. the problem is "forecasted"), and the third one requires some
   analysis to confirm if the detected Symptom requires any attention or
   immediate intervention (a.k.a. the problem is "potential").  As part
   of the iterative improvement required in this stage, one that is very
   relevant is the gradual conversion of the third category into one of
   the first two, which would make the network anomaly detection system
   more deterministic.  The main objective is to reduce uncertainty
   around the raised alarms by refining the detection algorithms.  This
   can be achieved by either generating new Symptom definitions,
   adjusting the weights of automated algorithms or other similar
   approaches.

5.2.  Network Anomaly Validation

   The key objective for the validation stage is clearly to decide if
   the detected Symptoms are signaling a real problem (a.k.a. requires
   action) or if they are to be treated as false positives (a.k.a.
   suppressing the alarm).  For those Symptoms surely having impact on
   connectivity services, 100% confidence on the fact that a network
   problem is happening can be assumed.  For the other two categories,
   "forecasted" and "potential", further analysis and validation is
   required.

5.3.  Network Anomaly Refinement

   After validation of a problem, the service provider performs
   troubleshooting and resolution of the problem.  Although the network
   might be back in a desired State at this point, network operators can
   perform detailed postmortem analysis of Problems with the objective
   to identify useful adjustments to the prevention and detection
   mechanisms (for instance improving or extending the definition of
   SLIs and SLOs, refining concern/impact scores, etc.), and improving
   the accuracy of the validation stage (e.g. automating parts of the
   validation, implementing automated root cause analysis and automation
   for remediation actions).  In this stage of the lifecycle it is
   assumed that the problem is under analysis.

   After the adjustments are performed to the network anomaly detection
   methods, the cycle starts again, by "replaying" the network anomaly
   and checking if there is any measurable improvement in the ability to
   detect Problems by using the updated method.  In some cases,
   detection can be improved by capturing additional or more appropriate
   metrics.

6.  Introducing a Label Store for Network Anomaly labels

   The information that is produced at each stage needs to be persisted
   and retrieved to perform the network anomaly lifecycle.

   The lifecycle begins with the detector notifying anomalies to the
   "Alarm and Problem Management System" and to the "Post-mortem System"
   according to (see [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture]).  In
   this case the Post-mortem system is identified as the Label Store.
   Once the notification arrives to the Label Store, the anomaly label
   is persisted.  In the following stages (i.e. validation and
   refinement), the information about the labels are retrieved,
   reviewed, modified and persisted again, generating every time a new
   version of the same annotation, or tagging the annotation as
   irrelevant, if it would be necessary to remove it.

   In the following sections, the following are defined:

   *  a state machine for a label

   *  a YANG data model for the notification sent by the Detector to the
      Label Store

   *  a YANG data model to the define the interrogation (and retrieval)
      of the persisted labels from the label store.

7.  Network Anomaly State Machine

   In the context of this document, from a network anomaly detection
   point of view a Problem is defined as a collection of interrelated
   Symptoms, as specified in [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-semantics].

   The understanding of a Problem can change over time.  Moreover,
   multiple actors are involved in the process of refining this
   understanding in the different phases.

   From this perspective, a problem can be refined according to the
   following States (Figure 2).

   The knowledge gained at each stage is encoded as a list of anomaly
   labels that can be stored on a Label Store.

8.  Network Anomaly Lifecycle Data Model

   The data model provides support for "human-in-the-loop", allowing for
   network experts to validate and adjust network anomaly labels and
   detection systems.  An example of human-in-the-loop has been
   demonstrated with Antagonist [Antagonist], by building a User
   Interface that interacts with an API based on this data model.

   The base for the modules is the "ietf-relevant-state" data model.
   Relevant State is at the root of the data model, with its parameters
   (ID, description, start-time, end-time) and a collection of
   anomalies.  This allows the Relevant State to be considered as a
   container of anomalies.

   Each anomaly is characterized by some intrinsic fields (such as id,
   version, state, description, start-time, end-time, confidence score
   and pattern) Particularly the confidence score is a measure of how
   confident was the detector in considering the given anomaly as an
   anomalous behaviour.

   Each anomaly also includes the symptom and the service container.
   These containers are placeholders to represent the information about
   the symptom (what exactly is happening as anomalous behaviour) and
   the connectivity service (what entity is affected by the anomaly).
   In particular, for what concerns the symptom, a concern score is
   defined as necessary field, which has the meaning of expressing how
   much the anomaly is impacting connectivity services.

   Concern and Confidence Scores are used to express two very different
   concepts, and it is important to make a clear distinction between
   them:

   *  the Confidence score tends to be higher when symptoms are more
      abnormal, for instance if some given values are very rare in the
      data or if they substantially deviate from expected behaviours.
      In those cases, detectors are more sure about the anomaly and this
      is reflected into higher confidence scores.

   *  the Concern Score tends to be higher when the symptom is likely
      having a higher impact on connectivity services.

   Although the two concepts can be somehow intertwined, in the scope of
   this document a clear way on how to use them is not provided, as this
   has been shown to be dependent on the use case and on the user of the
   system.

   In case additional information related to the symptom and to the
   service need to be provided, augmentation would be the appropriate
   mechanism to do so.  An example of this is provided in
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-semantics], where an augmentation of
   both symptom and service is provided for the specific case of anomaly
   labels related to connectivity services.

   Also a list of various actors that are involved in the process is
   presented as following:

   In the detection stage:  the detectors are either Network Engineers
      and/or Automatic detectors (including Rule-based detectors and ML-
      based detectors)

   In the validation stage:  the validators are Network Engineers
      manually validating the labels

Internet-Draft          network-anomaly-lifecycle          November 2025


   In the refinement stage:  the refiners are either Data Scientists
      and/or Automatic Refiners (including systems that automatically
      refine the detection systems, based on the validated labels).

   The data model defines a Relevant State container and a Relevant
   State notification: the notification is primarily used by the Network
   Anomaly Detector, to notify the "Alarm and Problem Management System"
   and the "Post-mortem System" (see
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture]); the container instead
   is used inside the Post-mortem system to exhance anomaly detection
   lables between the anomaly detection stages defined above
   (validation, refinement, detection).

8.1.  Overview of the Data Model for the Relevant State and all the
      related entities

   The "ietf-relevant-state" module defines a Relevant State container
   to report associated anomalies and a "relevant-state-notification"
   used for exchanging the relevant State information.  The following
   YANG tree diagram [RFC8340] shows the "ietf-relevant-state" model.

9.  Implementation status

   This section provides pointers to existing open source
   implementations of this document.  Note to the RFC-editor: Please
   remove this before publishing.

9.1.  Antagonist

   An open-source implementation for this document is called AnTagOnIst
   (Anomaly Tagging On hIstorical data), and it has been implemented in
   order to validate the application of the YANG model defined in this
   document.  Antagonist provides visual support for two important use
   cases in the scope of this document:

   *  the generation of a ground truth in relation to symptoms and
      Problems in timeseries data

   *  the visual validation of results produced by automated network
      anomaly detection tools.

   The open-source code can be found here: [Antagonist]

   As part of the experiment that was conducted with AnTagOnIst, Some
   main Use Case scenarios have been validated so far:

      Exposure of a GUI for human validation of the labels.

      Integration with Rule Based anomaly detection systems.  In
      particular the integration with SAIN and Cosmos Bright Lights is
      ongoing.

      Integration with ML-based detection systems.

10.  Security Considerations

   This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7
   of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The "ietf-network-anomaly-symptom-cbl" and "ietf-network-anomaly-
   service-topology" YANG modules defines two data models that are
   designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
   NETCONF [RFC6141] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  These protocols have to
   use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH [RFC4252], TLS [RFC8446], and
   QUIC [RFC9000]) and have to use mutual authentication.

Internet-Draft          network-anomaly-lifecycle          November 2025


   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true", which is the
   default).  All writable data nodes are likely to be reasonably
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write
   operations (e.g., edit-config) and delete operations to these data
   nodes without proper protection or authentication can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  The following subtrees and data nodes
   have particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

   "There are no particularly sensitive writable data nodes."

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Specifically, the following
   subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
   vulnerabilities:

   "There are no particularly sensitive readable data nodes."
